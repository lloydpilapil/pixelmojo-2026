---

## üéØ How the Chatbot Handles Pricing Queries

### **1. Tier-Based Responses**

The chatbot uses the **Growth tier** as the anchor (most popular), then mentions alternatives:

**Example Query**: "How much for a landing page?"

**Bot Response**:

> "For a landing page, I'd recommend our **Growth tier** at **$3,995-$5,995** (most popular!). This includes a multi-section page with conversion-focused copywriting, analytics setup, and 2 rounds of revisions. It's completed in 2-3 weeks.
>
> If you're just testing, we have a **Starter tier** at $1,995-$2,995. For full campaigns, there's a **Scale tier** at $7,995-$9,995 with email sequences and social graphics.
>
> What type of landing page are you looking to build?"

---

### **2. Philippine Startup Discount**

Automatically calculates 15-20% discount when relevant:

**Example Query**: "I'm a Philippine startup, how much for branding?"

**Bot Response**:

> "Great! We have a special üáµüá≠ **Philippine Startup discount** (15-20% off) for registered pre-seed/seed startups.
>
> Our **Revenue-First Design System (Growth tier)** is normally **$5,995-$9,995**, but with the Philippine discount, that becomes **$5,000-$8,500**. This includes your complete logo suite, comprehensive brand guidelines, marketing templates, and social media templates.
>
> To qualify, you'll need to be a registered Philippine startup at pre-seed or seed stage. We verify this during the discovery call. Would you like to book a call to discuss your brand needs?"

---

### **3. Package Combinations**

Smart bundling with calculations:

**Example Query**: "How much for branding and a landing page?"

**Bot Response**:

> "Perfect combination! I'd recommend:
>
> ‚Ä¢ **Revenue-First Design System (Growth tier)**: $5,995-$9,995
> ‚Ä¢ **Conversion Asset System (Growth tier)**: $3,995-$5,995
>
> **Total**: Around **$15,000**
>
> This gives you a complete brand identity PLUS a high-converting landing page with copywriting and analytics. Both are completed in about 6-8 weeks.
>
> **Philippine startup?** We can bring that down to around **$12,000** with our 15-20% discount.
>
> What's your target launch timeline?"

---

### **4. Budget-Conscious Queries**

Diplomatically suggests appropriate tiers:

**Example Query**: "I have $5,000 budget for a full product"

**Bot Response**:

> "With a $5,000 budget, I'd recommend starting with our **AI Product Development (Starter tier)** at **$4,995-$7,995**. This focuses on MVP validation:
>
> ‚úì User research (5-10 interviews)
> ‚úì Wireframes and user flows
> ‚úì Interactive prototype
> ‚úì Landing page for early signups
> ‚úì Technical architecture recommendations
>
> This is completed in 3-4 weeks and gives you validated product-market fit before investing in full development.
>
> Once validated, you can move to the **Growth tier** ($12,995-$19,995) for full product build. Would you like to start with validation?"

---

### **5. Comparison Queries**

Explains value vs traditional agencies:

**Example Query**: "Why not use a traditional agency?"

**Bot Response**:

> "Great question! Here's the honest comparison:
>
> **Traditional Agency:**
> ‚Ä¢ 6-12 month timelines
> ‚Ä¢ $50K-$200K+ budgets
> ‚Ä¢ Fixed deliverables
> ‚Ä¢ Handoff and done
>
> **Pixelmojo (AI-Powered):**
> ‚Ä¢ 4-12 week delivery
> ‚Ä¢ $1,995-$49,995 budgets
> ‚Ä¢ Flexible iteration
> ‚Ä¢ Post-launch support included
> ‚Ä¢ Built for ongoing optimization
>
> **Real example**: A traditional agency quoted $85K for 6 months. We delivered the same project for $19,995 in 10 weeks.
>
> We're AI-native from day one, so we're 3x faster with 60% fewer revisions. What type of project are you considering?"

## üéì Pricing Logic Rules

### **Tier Anchoring**

1. Always lead with **Growth tier** (marked ‚≠ê MOST POPULAR)
2. Mention Starter if budget-conscious
3. Mention Scale if they need premium features

### **Value Framing**

Use specific value propositions:

- "Only $X more but includes [specific benefits]"
- Example: "Only $5K more but includes complete design system + user flows + 1 month support"

### **Philippine Discount Calculation**

```
Original Price √ó 0.80 to 0.85 = Discounted Price
Example: $10,000 √ó 0.85 = $8,500
```

### **Package Bundling**

- Add individual tier prices
- Offer ~10% bundle discount if budget is tight
- Always show the math: "$9,995 + $4,995 = ~$15K"

### **Combination Suggestions**

Pre-configured combinations:

1. **Branding + Landing Page** = ~$15K (PH: ~$12K)
2. **Full Product + Branding** = ~$19K (PH: ~$15K)
3. **Landing Page + UI/UX** = ~$8.5K (PH: ~$7K)

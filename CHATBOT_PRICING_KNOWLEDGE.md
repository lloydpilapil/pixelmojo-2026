## 💬 How the Chatbot Handles Pricing Queries

### **Query 1: "How much does it cost?"**

**Bot Response:**

> "Great question! We use a **performance-based model** that's different from traditional agencies:
>
> **Step 1: 60-Day Conversion Sprint** (Start here)
> • **Philippine startups**: ₱180,000 (~$3,200)
> • **Global/US clients**: $4,500
>
> This is a one-time engagement where we prove value in 60 days. You get an AI-optimized landing page/funnel, A/B testing framework, and a clear performance report.
>
> **Step 2: Growth Retainer** (After proving results)
> • **Base**: $3,500/month (₱120K for PH)
> • **Plus bonuses**: $1K-$5K/month based on conversion lift
>
> **Why this works**: Most agencies want $8K-15K/month for 6-12 months before proving anything. We prove ourselves in 60 days first.
>
> Are you a Philippine startup or global client?"

---

### **Query 2: "Why is the Sprint cheaper than the retainer?"**

**Bot Response:**

> "It's not cheaper—it's our way of **proving ourselves** before you commit long-term!
>
> The Sprint is actually a loss-leader for us. We're betting that once you see 15-40% conversion lift in 60 days, you'll want to scale with our Growth Retainer.
>
> **The numbers**:
> • Sprint: $4,500 one-time (60 days)
> • Retainer: $3,500/month base + performance bonuses
>
> Most Sprint clients (70%) convert to retainers because the results speak for themselves. We're aligned with your success from day one.
>
> What type of conversion challenges are you facing right now?"

---

### **Query 3: "What if you don't deliver results?"**

**Bot Response:**

> "We measure everything. Here's our promise:
>
> If we don't hit conversion targets in the 60-day Sprint, we provide a **detailed analysis** of why and what needs to change. Often it's product-market fit issues, not design.
>
> **You'll know exactly**:
> ✓ What worked and what didn't (with data)
> ✓ Where the conversion leaks are
> ✓ What to fix to get better results
>
> **Our track record**: Most clients see 15-40% conversion lift in 60 days. If we can't move the needle, you'll know why—and you're not locked into any long-term contract.
>
> That's the advantage of our Sprint model vs traditional 6-12 month retainers.
>
> What's your current conversion rate?"

---

### **Query 4: "How is this different from typical agencies?"**

**Bot Response:**

> "Great question! Here's the honest comparison:
>
> **Traditional Agencies:**
> • $8K-15K/month fixed (regardless of results)
> • 6-12 month commitments before proving value
> • 2-3 month onboarding cycles
> • Opinion-based design decisions
> • One-time deliverables, then handoff
>
> **PixelMojo (AI-Native + Performance-Based):**
> • $4.5K Sprint → $3.5K base + bonuses
> • 60-day proof of value first
> • Ship in 2-3 week sprints
> • Every decision data-driven with AI
> • Self-improving systems, not static deliverables
>
> **Real example**: Traditional agencies quoted $85K for 6 months. We delivered measurable conversion lift in 60 days for $4.5K, then scaled with performance-based pricing.
>
> We're AI-native from day one, so we move 3-5x faster. What type of project are you considering?"

---

### **Query 5: "I'm a Philippine startup, how much discount do I get?"**

**Bot Response:**

> "Great! Our pricing is **already optimized for Philippine startups** 🇵🇭
>
> **60-Day Conversion Sprint**:
> • Philippine startups: ₱180,000 (~$3,200 USD)
> • Global/US clients: $4,500 USD
>
> **Growth Retainer** (after Sprint):
> • Philippine startups: ₱120,000/month base
> • Global/US clients: $3,500/month base
> • Plus performance bonuses for everyone
>
> **Why the price difference?**
> We price based on local market purchasing power. You get the same quality, same AI-native workflows, same results—just at rates that make sense for the Philippine market.
>
> We're based in the Philippines and want to support local startups! 🇵🇭
>
> What stage is your startup at right now?"

---

### **Query 6: "Can I negotiate the pricing?"**

**Bot Response:**

> "Here's our approach to pricing flexibility:
>
> **For funded startups** with compelling use cases (YC/Antler/500 Startups portfolio companies, etc.), we're open to discussion. We love backing ambitious founders.
>
> **For bootstrapped founders**, we can structure **payment plans**:
> • Split Sprint into 3 payments instead of 2
> • Delay retainer start by 30 days post-Sprint
> • Performance-based retainer from day one (lower base, higher bonuses)
>
> **What we won't compromise**: The 60-day Sprint comes first. We need to prove ourselves before long-term work.
>
> Tell me about your situation—are you funded or bootstrapped?"

---

### **Query 7: "I need a complete brand + website, how much?"**

**Bot Response:**

> "For a complete brand + website, here's how our Sprint model works:
>
> **Option 1: Start with Landing Page Sprint** ($4.5K)
> We optimize your core conversion funnel first (landing page), prove 15-40% lift in 60 days, then expand to full website + brand in the Growth Retainer.
>
> **Option 2: Custom Sprint Scope** (Contact for quote)
> If you need brand + multi-page website upfront, we can customize the Sprint deliverables. Pricing depends on scope, but typically $8K-12K for 60 days.
>
> **Recommended path**: Start with landing page Sprint ($4.5K) → See results → Scale to full brand + website in retainer ($3.5K/mo base).
>
> **Why?** You validate conversion strategy before investing in a full brand system. Smart startups test first, then scale.
>
> What's your target launch timeline?"

---

### **Query 8: "Do you do monthly retainer work?"**

**Bot Response:**

> "Yes! But here's how it works:
>
> **You must start with our 60-Day Conversion Sprint first** ($4.5K one-time). This proves we can deliver results for your specific business.
>
> **After the Sprint**, you can move to our **Growth Retainer**:
> • **Base**: $3,500/month (₱120K for PH startups)
> • **Performance bonuses**: $1K-$5K/month based on conversion lift
> • **Includes**: Monthly sprints, A/B testing, campaign management, quarterly strategy
>
> **Why Sprint first?**
> We don't want to lock you into monthly contracts before proving value. 70% of Sprint clients convert to retainers because they see real results.
>
> Traditional agencies want 6-12 month contracts upfront. We earn your business in 60 days.
>
> Ready to start with a Sprint?"

## 🎓 Pricing Logic Rules

### **Always Lead With Sprint**

- Every conversation about pricing MUST mention the Sprint first
- Never quote retainer pricing without explaining Sprint requirement
- Frame Sprint as "proof of value" not "cheap option"

### **Performance-Based Framing**

- Emphasize alignment: "We profit when you profit"
- Compare to traditional fixed pricing: "$8K-15K/month regardless of results"
- Use specific success metrics: "15-40% conversion lift in 60 days"

### **Philippine vs Global Pricing**

- Always ask location context
- Frame PH pricing as "optimized for local market" not "discount"
- Same quality, same AI workflows, just local pricing power

### **Retainer Eligibility**

- Must complete Sprint first (no exceptions)
- 70% conversion rate to retainer (social proof)
- Base + bonuses structure creates alignment

### Template 1: PH Fintech/SaaS Startups (Warm - Recent Funding/Launch)

**Subject:** Quick question about [Company]'s growth plans

**Message:**

```
Hi [Name],

Saw [Company] just [raised/launched/announced X] - congrats! üéâ

Quick question: As you scale, are you thinking about conversion optimization for [specific pain point - e.g., "your signup flow" or "landing page"]?

We're PixelMojo - 16 months in, AI-native from day one. We help B2B/SaaS startups like yours improve conversion rates 15-40% in 60 days using AI-powered design workflows.

No 6-month retainers. No creative fluff. Just data-driven sprints that move the needle.

Worth a 15-min chat to see if we can help you grow faster?

### Template 2: Global B2B/SaaS (Cold - Conversion Pain Point)

**Subject:** [Company]'s conversion rate

**Message:**

```
Hi [Name],

Checked out [Company]'s [landing page/signup flow/pricing page] - really clean design.

One thing caught my eye: [specific observation - e.g., "CTA is below the fold on mobile" or "form has 8 fields when 3 would convert better"].

We help B2B/SaaS companies optimize for conversion using AI-native workflows. Most clients see 15-40% lift in 60 days.

What we're NOT:
- Another expensive agency with 6-month minimums
- Creative team that bills hours vs results

What we ARE:
- Sprint-based (60 days to prove value)
- Performance-focused (we profit when you profit)
- Fast AF (AI-native means we ship in weeks, not months)

Quick 15-min call to show you what we'd optimize first?

### Template 3: PH Agency Job Posters/Commenters (Warm - Hiring Pain Point)

**Subject:** Alternative to hiring in-house

**Message:**

```
Hi [Name],

Saw you're [hiring a designer/looking for a dev/expanding the team].

Not here to pitch against your hire - but curious: Have you considered a "hybrid" model?

We're PixelMojo, an AI-native design shop. Some of our clients use us as their "interim design/dev team" while they recruit, or even long-term as their "external sprint team."

Benefits vs traditional hire:
- Start Monday (not 3-month recruitment)
- No overhead (salary, benefits, management)
- Performance-based pricing (pay more only when we deliver results)
- Scale up/down as needed

We've helped companies like [redacted logistics firm - ‚Ç±600K project] and several SaaS startups launch/optimize faster.

Worth a quick chat to see if this model fits your needs?

- Lloyd
PixelMojo.io
```

**When to use:** Job posts, LinkedIn hiring announcements, "we're growing" posts
**Target:** Founders, HR/Talent Leads, CTOs
**Follow-up:** 4-5 days if no response

### Template 4: Influencer/Content Creator Collaboration (Warm)

**Subject:** Collab idea for [Influencer Name]

**Message:**

```
Hi [Name],

Love your content on [specific topic - e.g., "startup growth" or "B2B marketing"]. Your post on [specific post topic] really resonated.

I'm Lloyd from PixelMojo - we're an AI-native design agency for startups (16 months in, bootstrapped, profitable).

Collaboration idea: What if we partnered on a case study/content series?

Concept:
- We run a FREE 60-day conversion sprint for one of your audience members
- Document the entire process (challenges, wins, AI workflows)
- Co-create content (LinkedIn posts, YouTube video, or blog series)
- You get valuable content, they get free optimization, we get a case study

Your audience gets to see real results + AI workflows in action. Win-win-win.

Interested in exploring this?

Saw [Event/Accelerator Name] is [upcoming cohort/event] - your focus on [specific focus - e.g., "early-stage SaaS"] aligns perfectly with our sweet spot.

Partnership idea:

**Email Body:**

```
Hi [Name],

Lloyd from PixelMojo here - we worked together on [project name] [X months/year ago].

- Limited ongoing support

**NEW MODEL (what we do now):**
- 60-day conversion sprints (prove value fast)

‚úÖ **Correct name spelling & title** (check LinkedIn before sending)

## Response Handling Scripts

### If they reply "What's your pricing?"

```
Great question! We have two main offerings:

**60-Day Conversion Sprint - $4,500 (‚Ç±180K for PH startups)**
Perfect for: Proving value fast, specific conversion goals, tight budgets
Includes: [bullet points from pricing page]

**Growth Retainer - $3.5K/month base + performance bonuses**
Perfect for: Ongoing optimization, scaling what works
Pricing: You pay a low base, we earn real money only when you grow

Most clients start with the Sprint to see what we can do, then convert to retainer.

What stage are you in? [qualifying question]
```

### If they reply "Send me more info"

```
Happy to! Here's what I'll send:

1. **60-Day Sprint Overview** (1-page PDF)
2. **Case study** (logistics platform we built - ‚Ç±600K project)
3. **Sample Sprint Proposal** (so you see our approach)

Quick question before I send: What's your #1 conversion challenge right now? (Helps me personalize what I send)
```

### If they reply "Not right now"

```
Totally understand - timing is everything.

Quick ask: What would need to change for this to be relevant? (budget unlocks, Q2 planning, hit a growth milestone, etc.?)

Either way, staying in touch. I'll check back in [X months/after milestone].

And if you know anyone in growth mode who could use conversion help, I'd appreciate the intro!
```

### If they reply "We're happy with our current agency"

```
Love to hear it! Good agencies are hard to find.

Out of curiosity - are they performance-based, or traditional retainer?

(Just asking because our model is pretty different - we do short sprints + performance bonuses vs long retainers. Some clients use us alongside their main agency for specific conversion projects.)

Either way, happy to stay in your orbit for when needs change!
```

## A/B Testing Your Outreach

Track these metrics weekly:

| Template    | Sent | Opens (Email) | Replies | Positive Response | Call Booked |
| ----------- | ---- | ------------- | ------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| LinkedIn T1 |      | N/A           |         |                   |             |
| LinkedIn T2 |      | N/A           |         |                   |             |
| Email T1    |      |               |         |                   |             |
| Email T2    |      |               |         |                   |             |

**Winning template = 20%+ reply rate**
**Losing template = <10% reply rate (revise or kill)**

Test one variable at a time:

- Call-to-action
- Personalization depth

## Tools You Need

**LinkedIn:**

- LinkedIn Sales Navigator (optional, $99/month - better search)
- Dux-Soup or Expandi (automation - use carefully to avoid bans)
- Personal profile optimization (make sure YOUR profile converts)

**Email:**

- HubSpot Free CRM (track outreach)
- Mailtrack or Yesware (email opens tracking)
- Calendly (booking tool)
- Hunter.io or Apollo.io (find email addresses)

**Templates:**

- Save these in HubSpot snippets or Text Expander
- Personalize 3-5 details per message (don't mass blast)

---

## Daily Habit: The "50 Before Noon" Rule

Before lunch every day:

- Review 50 potential leads (LinkedIn, Perplexity research, funding announcements)
- Engage with 10 (like/comment on posts)
- Message 10 (using templates above)
- Follow up with 5 (previous outreach)

**Result:** 200+ touches/week, 10-15 calls/month, 2-4 Sprint clients closed

---

**Remember:** You're not selling. You're finding startups who have the problem you solve, and showing them a faster/better way to fix it.

Your job is to START conversations, not CLOSE deals on LinkedIn/Email. Get to the call.

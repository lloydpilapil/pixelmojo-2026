## Slide 1: TITLE SLIDE

## Slide 2: THE PROBLEM (Make Them Nod)

**Visual:** Side-by-side comparison (traditional agency pain)

### Traditional Agencies Are Broken for Startups

**What startups actually need:**
‚úÖ Fast execution (weeks, not months)
‚úÖ Measurable results (conversion %, not "brand awareness")
‚úÖ Flexible pricing (pay for performance, not hours)
‚úÖ No BS (straight talk, no creative fluff)

**What traditional agencies offer:**
‚ùå 6-12 month retainer commitments
‚ùå $8K-15K/month regardless of results
‚ùå 2-3 month onboarding cycles
‚ùå "Trust the creative process"

**The gap:** You need to prove traction to investors/board. They need you to "trust" them for 6+ months.

---

## Slide 3: THE PIXELMOJO DIFFERENCE

**Visual:** Three pillars graphic

### We're Built Different Because We ARE a Startup

**üöÄ Speed: AI-Native Workflows**

- 3-5x faster than traditional agencies
- Ship in weeks, not months
- No "creative process" delays

**Bottom line:** We're a 16-month-old startup. We GET the pressure of proving ROI fast.

## Slide 6: GROWTH RETAINER (The Upsell)

**Visual:** Pricing breakdown with performance tiers

### After the Sprint: Scale What Works

**Monthly Retainer Model**

**Base Retainer:**

- Global: $3,500/month
- PH: ‚Ç±120,000/month

**Performance Bonuses** (paid quarterly):

- 15-25% conversion lift: +$1K/month (+‚Ç±30K)
- 25-40% lift: +$2.5K/month (+‚Ç±75K)
- 40%+ lift: +$5K/month (+‚Ç±150K)

**What's Included:**

- Monthly design/dev sprints
- Ongoing A/B testing & optimization
- Campaign management
- Quarterly strategy sessions
- Priority support

**Why This Works:**
We only make real profit when you grow. You get a committed partner, not a vendor billing hours.

**Conversion Rate:** ~70% of successful Sprints convert to retainer

## Slide 8: WHO WE'RE PERFECT FOR (Qualification)

**Visual:** Checkboxes or iconography for ideal client

### Is the Sprint Model Right for You?

**Perfect Fit ‚úÖ**

- B2B/SaaS startups (seed to Series A)
- Minimum 3K visitors/month OR active user base
- Clear conversion goals (signups, demos, purchases)
- Product-market fit validated (not building MVP)
- Need to prove ROI in weeks, not months
- Access to analytics (GA4, Mixpanel, etc.)

**Not a Fit ‚ùå**

- Brand-new startups (pre-launch, no traffic)
- "We need a website" with no conversion goal
- Enterprise with 6-month procurement cycles
- Looking for "creative" without measurement
- No budget/resources for implementation

**Honesty:** We turn away ~40% of inquiries because fit matters more than revenue.

## Slide 10: FAQ (Objection Handling)

**Visual:** Q&A format, clean typography

### Common Questions (Let's Address Them Now)

**Q: Why is the Sprint cheaper than your retainer?**
A: It's not‚Äîit's our way of proving ourselves before you commit long-term. Most Sprint clients convert to retainers because results speak for themselves.

**Q: What if you don't deliver results?**
A: We measure everything. If we don't hit conversion targets, we'll tell you exactly why (often it's product-market fit, not design). You'll know what to fix.

**Q: How is this different from Propel Manila, Emerge, [local competitor]?**
A: Three ways:

1. Speed: AI-native workflows = 3-5x faster
2. Measurement: Every decision is data-driven
3. Alignment: Performance bonuses mean we profit when you profit

**Q: Can we start with just design, then add dev later?**
A: We can, but we don't recommend it. Our model works because design + dev + optimization happens in tight loops. Splitting them slows everything down.

**Q: Do you work with [specific industry]?**
A: If you have a conversion goal and traffic/users to test with, yes. We've worked in logistics, SaaS, fintech, e-commerce.

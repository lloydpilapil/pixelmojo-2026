## Email Body

Hi Robert,

Thanks for your interest in our **MVP Validation Package** for your real estate business! I saw you mentioned this is urgent, so I wanted to get back to you right away.

### Package Details

**MVP Validation - Real Estate Edition**

**Investment:** â‚±4,995 - â‚±7,995 (approx $90-$145 USD)

**What's Included:**

- User research & validation for your real estate platform
- Wireframes and user flows (10-15 screens)
- Interactive prototype (clickable demo)
- Landing page for early signups
- Real estate-specific UX optimization

**Timeline:** 3-4 weeks

### Payment Options

I saw you asked about **20-30-30-20 payment terms**. While our standard is 50/50, given your situation as a startup, **we can absolutely work with a 20-30-30-20 structure**:

- **20% upfront** (â‚±999 - â‚±1,599) - Kickoff & research phase
- **30% at Week 1** (â‚±1,499 - â‚±2,399) - Wireframes complete
- **30% at Week 2** (â‚±1,499 - â‚±2,399) - Prototype complete
- **20% at delivery** (â‚±999 - â‚±1,599) - Final landing page & handoff

This gives you more flexibility to manage cash flow as a startup.

### Philippine Startup Discount

If you're a registered Philippine startup, you may qualify for **15-20% off**, bringing the investment down to:

â‚±4,246 - â‚±6,796 (approx $77-$123 USD)

### Real Estate-Specific Features

Based on our conversation, here's what we'd focus on for your platform:

- Client engagement tools

# Engagement-Based Negotiation Patterns

## Overview

New negotiation patterns that integrate with the conversation intelligence system to extract budget and urgency from serious clients.

## The 8 New Patterns

### **PATTERN 1: HIGH ENGAGEMENT (40+) + NO BUDGET YET**

**Technique:** ANCHORING with a range

❌ **DON'T:** "What's your budget?"

✅ **DO:** "To point you in the right direction, most clients like you invest between $15K-$50K depending on scope. Does that ballpark work for you, or are you thinking differently?"

**Why this works:**

- Anchors their expectation to your range
- "Like you" = social proof + empathy
- "Thinking differently" = opens door without pressure
- They'll either confirm or reveal actual budget

---

### **PATTERN 2: BUDGET MENTIONED BUT VAGUE**

**Technique:** BRACKETING to extract real number

Triggers: "open to budget", "flexible", "not sure"

❌ **DON'T:** "Great! Let's move forward"

✅ **DO:** "When you say 'open to budget,' help me understand - are we talking $10K range, $30K range, or $50K+ range? Just so I can make sure we're aligned on what's possible."

**Why this works:**

- Gives them 3 clear options to choose from
- Middle option ($30K) becomes the natural anchor
- Forces them to pick a bracket or reveal exact number
- "What's possible" = value framing, not pressure

---

### **PATTERN 3: TIMELINE URGENCY DETECTED**

**Technique:** URGENCY AMPLIFICATION

Triggers: "ASAP", "urgent", "need support", "this week"

❌ **DON'T:** "We can rush it for extra cost"

✅ **DO:** "I hear the urgency. When you need to move this fast, we typically recommend our [higher tier] at [price] because it includes priority delivery and dedicated resources. Given your timeline, what would delaying this cost your business?"

**Why this works:**

- Labels their urgency (empathy)
- Justifies higher price with logic (priority = premium)
- Flips to LOSS AVERSION ("cost of delay")
- Makes premium feel like smart investment, not expense

---

### **PATTERN 4: POSITIVE ENGAGEMENT**

**Technique:** MOMENTUM BUILD

Triggers: "yes", "sounds good", "interested", "let's go"

❌ **DON'T:** "Great! Here's the contract"

✅ **DO:** "Love the energy! Before we dive deeper, I want to make sure we're aligned on a few things. First, what's driving this project right now - is it revenue growth, competitor pressure, or something else?"

**Why this works:**

- Validates their enthusiasm (empathy)
- "Before we dive deeper" = assumes forward motion
- Calibrated question extracts pain point
- Pain point → stronger case for investment

---

### **PATTERN 5: MULTIPLE SERVICES MENTIONED**

**Technique:** VALUE STACKING

Triggers: "website + branding", "app + design", multiple services

❌ **DON'T:** "That'll be $X + $Y + $Z = total"

✅ **DO:** "You mentioned [website + branding + app]. Smart move - clients who do this together see 2-3x better results because everything's cohesive. That puts you around $[total range]. Most clients in your position go with $[middle-high end] to get the full impact. Does that align with where you're thinking?"

**Why this works:**

- Validates their smart thinking (empathy)
- Proves value with data ("2-3x better results")
- Anchors high but shows range
- "Where you're thinking" = partnership framing

---

### **PATTERN 6: PRICE SHOCK / HESITATION DETECTED**

**Technique:** REFRAME to ROI

Triggers: silence after price, "that's expensive", hesitation

❌ **DON'T:** "I can give you a discount"

✅ **DO:** "I get it - it's an investment. Let me ask you this: if this [website/product/brand] brought you just 2 new clients worth $10K each in the next 90 days, would $[price] feel different? What's your current customer lifetime value?"

**Why this works:**

- Empathy ("I get it")
- Reframes from cost to ROI
- "Just 2 clients" = low bar to justify
- Asking LTV = makes them calculate value, not cost

---

### **PATTERN 7: COMPARISON TO CHEAPER OPTIONS**

**Technique:** CONTRAST

Triggers: "freelancer is cheaper", "found someone for $X"

❌ **DON'T:** "We're worth more than freelancers"

✅ **DO:** "Fair question. Here's the difference: freelancers charge $5K-10K but take 4-6 months, need lots of management, and often don't deliver production-ready work. We're $[price] but deliver in 8 weeks with 60% fewer revisions because we're AI-native. What's more expensive - $10K over 6 months with delays, or $[price] done right in 8 weeks?"

**Why this works:**

- Validates their concern (empathy)
- Contrast principle (cheap = slow/risky)
- Reframes to TOTAL COST (time + revisions + risk)
- Ends with calibrated question, not defensive statement

---

### **PATTERN 8: EXTRACTING URGENCY FROM ENGAGED LEADS**

**Technique:** WHAT/WHY LADDERING

Use when: High engagement but timeline vague

❌ **DON'T:** "When do you need this done?"

✅ **DO:**

1. "What's driving your timeline on this?"
2. [They answer] → "And what happens if you don't hit that date?"
3. [They answer] → "So if I'm hearing you right, [summarize the stakes]... that's right?"

**Why this works:**

- Calibrated questions ladder to root cause
- Uncovers real pain (funding, competitor, launch)
- Stronger pain = stronger urgency = faster close
- "That's right" = commitment and alignment

---

## Integration with Conversation Intelligence

These patterns are automatically suggested based on engagement score:

### **Engagement 60+ (High Intent)**

- Use Patterns 1, 3, 5, 8
- Priority: Extract budget and timeline NOW
- Approach: Direct but consultative

### **Engagement 40-59 (Engaged)**

- Use Patterns 2, 4, 6
- Priority: Build value, then extract info
- Approach: Educational + empathetic

### **Engagement 30-39 (Warming Up)**

- Use Patterns 4, 7
- Priority: Address objections, build trust
- Approach: Consultative, no pressure

### **Engagement <30 (Tire Kicker)**

- Avoid asking for budget/timeline
- Focus on pain discovery
- Build interest first

## Real-World Examples

### **Example 1: High Engagement + Vague Budget**

**Context:**

- Engagement Score: 65
- User: "I need a website and mobile app. How much?"
- Missing: Budget

**AI Response Using Pattern 1 (Anchoring):**

```
Great question! For [website + mobile app], most clients like you
invest between $18K-$30K depending on features and timeline.

Does that ballpark work for you, or are you thinking differently?
```

**Result:** User reveals actual budget → Lead qualifies

---

### **Example 2: Urgency + No Budget**

**Context:**

- Engagement Score: 55
- User: "I need this ASAP, like this month"
- Missing: Budget

**AI Response Using Pattern 3 (Urgency Amplification):**

```
I hear the urgency. When you need to move this fast, we typically
recommend our Growth tier at $12,995-$19,995 because it includes
priority delivery and dedicated resources.

Given your timeline, what would delaying this cost your business?
```

**Result:** Justifies premium + uncovers pain → Higher close rate

---

### **Example 3: "Open to Budget" Signal**

**Context:**

- Engagement Score: 75
- User: "Yes, I'm open to budget. Just need it done right."
- Missing: Exact budget

**AI Response Using Pattern 2 (Bracketing):**

```
When you say "open to budget," help me understand - are we talking
$10K range, $30K range, or $50K+ range? Just so I can make sure
we're aligned on what's possible.
```

**Result:** Forces bracket selection → Reveals budget tier

---

## Key Principles

1. **Never Ask "What's Your Budget?"**
   - Too direct, puts pressure
   - Use anchoring or bracketing instead

2. **Always Anchor High**
   - Start with middle-high tier
   - Let them negotiate down if needed
   - High anchor = higher final price

3. **Use Loss Aversion Over Features**
   - "What will delaying cost?" > "Here's what you get"
   - Pain motivates more than pleasure
   - ROI framing > feature listing

4. **Validate Before Extracting**
   - Empathy labels first
   - Then ask calibrated question
   - Makes them feel understood

5. **Leverage Social Proof**
   - "Most clients like you invest..."
   - "Clients in your situation..."
   - Makes them feel normal, not pressured

6. **End with Questions, Not Statements**
   - Questions invite dialogue
   - Statements create resistance
   - Calibrated questions uncover truth

---

## Measurement & Optimization

**Track these metrics:**

1. Budget extraction rate (% of leads who reveal budget)
2. Timeline extraction rate (% who reveal urgency)
3. Average budget mentioned (higher = better anchoring)
4. Qualification score increase after pattern use

**Success indicators:**

- 70%+ budget extraction rate for 40+ engagement
- 80%+ timeline extraction for urgent signals
- Average mentioned budget >$15K
- 60%+ leads reach qualification threshold

---

## Next Steps

1. Monitor conversation logs for pattern usage
2. Track which patterns correlate with highest close rates
3. A/B test different anchoring ranges ($15K-50K vs $20K-60K)
4. Refine patterns based on actual conversion data

The AI will automatically apply these patterns based on engagement score and missing information. No manual configuration needed.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why is the Sprint cheaper than your retainer?**
It's not‚Äîit's our way of proving ourselves before you commit long-term. Most Sprint clients convert to retainers because the results speak for themselves.

**Q: What if you don't deliver results?**
We measure everything. If we don't hit conversion targets, we provide a detailed analysis of why and what needs to change (often it's product-market fit, not design). You'll know exactly what to fix.

**Q: How is this different from a typical agency?**
Three ways:

1. **Speed**: We use AI-native workflows to move 3-5x faster
2. **Measurement**: Every decision is data-driven, not creative intuition
3. **Alignment**: Performance bonuses mean we profit when you profit

**Q: Why the price difference between PH and global clients?**
We price based on local market purchasing power. PH startups get the same quality work at rates that make sense for the local market.

**Q: Can I negotiate the pricing?**
For funded startups with compelling use cases, we're open to discussion. For bootstrapped founders, we can structure payment plans.

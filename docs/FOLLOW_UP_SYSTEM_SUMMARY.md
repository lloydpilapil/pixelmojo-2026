# Automated Follow-Up Email System - Implementation Summary

## What Was Built

An AI-powered automated follow-up system that re-engages warm leads (scored 40-59) with personalized emails based on their actual conversation context.

---

## üéØ Problem Solved

**Before:** Leads like robert-claro@gmail.com showed clear interest but scored below 60 (due to missed extraction signals). They received no follow-up and were lost.

**After:** System automatically detects warm leads (40-59 score), analyzes their conversation, generates personalized follow-up emails, and sends them 2-4 hours later via Resend.

## üîÑ System Flow

```
1. Lead converses with AI chatbot
2. Lead extraction runs (updated with better signals)
3. Score calculated (40-59 = warm lead)
4. Lead saved to database
5. Cron job runs every 2 hours
6. System finds leads:
   - Score 40-59
   - Has email
   - Created 2-48 hours ago
   - No follow-up sent yet
7. AI analyzes conversation transcript
8. Generates personalized email:
   - Subject (6-10 words, curiosity-driven)
   - HTML body (200-300 words)
   - Text body (plain text version)
9. Sends via Resend (from lloyd@mg.pixelmojo.com)
10. Updates lead with timestamp + subject
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Required

### Environment Variables

Add to `.env.local`:

```bash
# Already exists
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
RESEND_API_KEY=re_...
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL="Lloyd from Pixelmojo <lloyd@mg.pixelmojo.com>"
SUPABASE_URL=https://...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJ...

# New (for cron security)
CRON_SECRET=your-random-secret-here
```

### Database Migration

Run this migration in Supabase:

```bash
# Apply migration 011
# File: supabase/migrations/011_add_follow_up_fields.sql
```

Or run in Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
ALTER TABLE public.leads
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS follow_up_sent_at timestamptz,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS follow_up_subject text;

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_leads_follow_up_needed
ON public.leads (qualification_score, follow_up_sent_at, created_at)
WHERE email IS NOT NULL
  AND qualification_score >= 40
  AND qualification_score < 60
  AND follow_up_sent_at IS NULL;
```

## üß™ How to Test

### 1. Check Eligible Leads

```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-follow-up.ts
```

This will show:

- Leads needing follow-ups
- Environment variables status
- Example curl commands

### 2. Manual Trigger (Test)

```bash
# List eligible leads
curl http://localhost:3000/api/leads/follow-up

# Send follow-up to specific lead
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/leads/follow-up \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"leadId": "uuid-here"}'
```

### 3. Cron Job (Production)

Once deployed to Vercel, the cron runs automatically every 2 hours.

## üìä Email Personalization

The AI adapts the email based on conversation signals:

| Signal Detected                      | Email Approach                                         |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| "konti budget", "pricey"             | Emphasizes flexible payment (20-30-30-20), PH discount |
| "urgent", "ASAP", "need support"     | Highlights 48-hour start, fast turnaround              |
| Specific package (MVP, Growth)       | Deep dive into package details, case studies           |
| Industry mention (real estate, SaaS) | References relevant portfolio work                     |
| Multiple services                    | Explains integrated approach, bundle value             |

## üéØ Eligibility Criteria

A lead receives follow-up if:

‚úÖ **Score:** 40-59 (warm but not qualified)
‚úÖ **Email:** Has valid email address
‚úÖ **Timing:** Created 2-48 hours ago
‚úÖ **Status:** No follow-up sent yet

**Why these criteria?**

- **< 40 score:** Too cold, unlikely to convert
- **‚â• 60 score:** Already qualified, gets immediate email
- **< 2 hours:** Give them time to return naturally
- **> 48 hours:** Lead is cold, low conversion probability

## üîß Maintenance

### Monitor These

1. **Cron job health**
   - Check Vercel logs daily
   - Alert if errors > 5% of runs

2. **Email deliverability**
   - Check Resend dashboard for bounces
   - Maintain < 5% bounce rate

3. **AI generation quality**
   - Spot-check generated emails weekly
   - Refine prompt if quality drops

4. **Database performance**
   - Monitor query time for follow-up index
   - Should be < 100ms for eligible leads query

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Production**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: automated follow-up email system"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Apply Database Migration**
   - Run migration 011 in Supabase dashboard

3. **Set Environment Variables**
   - Add `CRON_SECRET` to Vercel environment

4. **Monitor First Week**
   - Check cron logs daily
   - Verify emails are sending correctly
   - Track response rates

5. **Optimize Based on Data**
   - After 2 weeks, analyze:
     - Which subject lines perform best
     - Optimal time window (2-4 hours vs 4-8 hours)
     - Response rate by industry/project type

## üéâ Impact

**Before this system:**

- Warm leads (40-59) were lost
- No automated re-engagement
- Manual follow-up was inconsistent
- Example: robert-claro case (scored 40, lost opportunity)

**After this system:**

- Automatic re-engagement within 2-8 hours
- Personalized emails based on actual conversation
- Consistent follow-up for all warm leads
- Expected 10-15% conversion to qualified leads

**Estimated value:** If 10 warm leads/month convert at 15% ‚Üí 1.5 additional qualified leads/month ‚Üí ~$5K-15K additional revenue/month
